HOTEL BOOKING SYSTEM.  

- The Hotel Booking System is a basic computer program that helps manage hotel rooms. It lets users see which rooms are free, book a room, or cancel a booking. This makes it quick and easy to find and manage rooms.
- The system has the following features:
1. View Available Rooms: The program shows all the rooms in the hotel, and whether each room is available for booking or already booked.
2. Book a Room: Users can book a room, which means marking it as unavailable (booked).
3. Release a Room: If a room was booked but the user no longer needs it, the room can be released, making it available for others.
4. Exit: The user can close the program when done.

* Why Did I Make This Application? 
- I made this app to practice using binary trees, a type of data structure, in a real-world example. Hotel booking is simple and useful, so it was a good choice to try out what I’ve learned.

* How Does This Application Contribute to Me and the Community?
     - As a college student, I’m still improving at writing good code, and this helped me practice. It also showed me how to plan a program and break a big problem into smaller steps,
       which is important in software development.
    - For others, this system could help small hotels or hostels that don’t have fancy booking software. It’s a simple tool to manage rooms easily without spending a lot of
      money. Even though it’s basic, it shows how technology can make tasks like booking a room simpler and faster.

Priority Task Scheduler

What is it?
The Priority Scheduler is a simple program that helps organize tasks based on their priority. It uses a priority queue, so tasks with higher importance (lower number) are handled first. It’s easy to use and runs in the console.

What can it do?
1.Add tasks with a name and priority.
2.View the next task to be done.
3.Execute the task with the highest priority.
4.Exit the program when done.

Why did I make it?
I made this program to practice using data structures like priority queues. It helped me understand how task scheduling works, like in operating systems or simple to-do list apps. It’s a small but useful project for learning.

How does it help?
For me: It helped me learn Java and how to manage tasks in an organized way.
For others: It can show how to use priority queues and is useful for students learning about scheduling or task management.



//Basic Hashing and Hash Table!

Student Directory

What is it?
The Student Directory is a simple Java program that helps manage student records. It uses a hash table to store student IDs and names.

What can it do?
1. Add a Student: Save a student's ID and name.  
2. View a Student: Find a student's name using their ID.  
3. Delete a Student: Remove a student from the list using their ID.  
4. Exit: Close the program.

Why did I make it?
Practice coding and learn how to use hash tables (HashMap) in Java. Create a simple tool to show how to store and retrieve data quickly.

How does it help?
For me: It helped me practice coding and learn about managing data.
For others: It might be easy to understand and a good starting point for beginners learning Java.
