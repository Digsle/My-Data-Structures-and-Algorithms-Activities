HOTEL BOOKING SYSTEM.  

- The Hotel Booking System is a basic computer program that helps manage hotel rooms. It lets users see which rooms are free, book a room, or cancel a booking. This makes it quick and easy to find and manage rooms.
- The system has the following features:
1. View Available Rooms: The program shows all the rooms in the hotel, and whether each room is available for booking or already booked.
2. Book a Room: Users can book a room, which means marking it as unavailable (booked).
3. Release a Room: If a room was booked but the user no longer needs it, the room can be released, making it available for others.
4. Exit: The user can close the program when done.

* Why Did I Make This Application? 
		- I made this app to practice using binary trees, a type of data structure, in a real-world example. Hotel booking is simple and useful, so it was a good choice to try out what I’ve learned.

* How Does This Application Contribute to Me and the Community?
     - As a college student, I’m still improving at writing good code, and this helped me practice. It also showed me how to plan a program and break a big problem into smaller steps,
       which is important in software development.
    - For others, this system could help small hotels or hostels that don’t have fancy booking software. It’s a simple tool to manage rooms easily without spending a lot of
      money. Even though it’s basic, it shows how technology can make tasks like booking a room simpler and faster.
